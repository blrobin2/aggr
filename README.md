Music review site aggregator

I have 4 sites that I like to get album reviews from: Pitchfork, Metacritic, Stereogum, and Consequence of Sound. I was tired of Metacritic's spotty RSS feed, and maintaining a list from each of them, so I made a little app that builds some JSON daily of the albums of this month from each site. It isn't great, and pretty inflexible, but I'm working on it. Theoretically, if an RSS conforms to the same standard as a couple of these, then there's room for extensibility. I'm not saying I'll do that, but if you're interested in that sort of thing, there's some potentially useful ideas here.
